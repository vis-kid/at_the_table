### Questions:
- What do you think most about these days<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- You wrote a wonderful peace about being scrappy on your blog. How would you say designers can exercise more scrappiness—maybe especially within organisations that have outgrown that mindset or have been following the allure of growing large<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- Why do you think designers don’t already have a bigger seat at the table in the tech industry<span class="q">?</span> It seems to me that this is still an ongoing struggle for many designers.<br><br>
- How and when did you get into design<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- I found out that you like to design by looking at nature for inspiration. How do design for digital products by having nature in mind<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- I think it’s fair to say that the transformation and impact of open source software over the last 15 years or so is unprecedented. Do you think a similar transformation is gonna happen for digital product design<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- As a successful, well-known person in the tech world, and more importantly as a business owner, how do you avoid not hearing the truth from people around you<span class="q">?</span> How do you avoid being blind sided by too much ass kissing and the pats on the shoulder<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- How do you give your employees enough room to disagree with you<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- I was wondering, do you think that craziness at work might actually benefit a significant number of businesses<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- I got the impression that Basecamp was never really battling with snake pit issues in the organisation. Do you think your disgust of leverage over your employees plays a big role in that equation<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- Without going into private specifics, how do you usually resolve heated conflicts among the top of Basecamp’s decision makers<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
- Do you think you will open a coffee shop when you retire<span class="q">?</span><br><br>
